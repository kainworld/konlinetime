# konlinetime
A simple Minecraft plugin which counts the online time of players.

OnlineTime
This plugin measures the total time players are connected to your server network.

This plugin is based on Mr_Minecraft15's plugin OnlineTime, but I've more or less completely rewritten everything up to the point where it is barely noticeable.

Features:
Every message (including prefix) is customizable!
Store data in YAML or MySQL
extreme multiprogramming, zero blocking operations on I/O-threads cause zero lag
PlaceholderAPI support
